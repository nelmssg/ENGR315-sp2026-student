### Understanding Module Organization

Each module typically contains:
- **0 - Lecture Examples/** - Code demonstrated in class
- **1, 2, 3 - Practice/** - Optional practice problems
- **4 - Assignments/** - Graded homework assignments

## 🚀 Getting Started

**👉 [Follow the Setup Guide](GETTING_STARTED.md)** to install Python, VSCode, and clone this repository.

If you're already set up:
1. Pull the latest changes from this repository regularly
2. Check Canvas for assignment due dates
3. Submit assignments through the course LMS/Gradescope

## 📊 Real-World Datasets

You'll work with authentic engineering data throughout the course:

- **COVID-19 Data**: Epidemiological analysis
- **Biomechanics**: Drop-jump performance metrics
- **EKG Signals**: Heart rate detection algorithms
- **Materials Testing**: Tensile strength analysis
- **Optimization**: Traveling salesman problems

## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Start assignments early** - Debugging takes time!
2. **Read error messages carefully** - They usually tell you what's wrong
3. **Use office hours** - We're here to help
4. **Practice coding regularly** - Consistency is key
5. **Comment your code** - Your future self will thank you

## 🆘 Getting Help

- **Lecture/Lab**: Ask questions during class
- **Office Hours**: Check Canvas for times and locations
- **Discussion Board**: Post questions on Canvas
- **Email**: Reach out to instructor or TAs

## 📝 Academic Integrity

- You may collaborate with classmates on concepts and problem-solving approaches
- **You must write your own code** - copying code is plagiarism
- Cite any external resources (Stack Overflow, tutorials, etc.)
- When in doubt, ask!

## 🔄 Keeping Your Repository Updated

When new assignments or fixes are posted:

1. Open **GitHub Desktop**
2. Make sure this repository is selected
3. Click **Fetch origin** and then **Merge from upstream/main**
4. New materials will be downloaded and merged to your computer

If you run into merge conflicts, ask for help!
